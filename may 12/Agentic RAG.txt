Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG is an advanced technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines two powerful components: retrieval-based methods and generation-based models. The term "Agentic" refers to the ability of the model to act like an intelligent agent, autonomously retrieving and utilizing relevant information. RAG stands for Retriever-Augmented Generation, where the system first retrieves relevant documents or data, and then generates responses based on this information.
In a typical RAG system, a retriever model searches through a large database of documents to find the most relevant pieces of information for a given query. Once the relevant documents are identified, a generator model (usually a large language model like GPT) creates a response based on both the retrieved information and the question posed by the user. The result is a more accurate, context-aware response that goes beyond simple text generation.
This technique is particularly useful in applications like question answering, chatbots, and personal assistants, where the system needs to provide highly accurate and contextually relevant responses. One key advantage of Agentic RAG is that it can handle dynamic, real-time information, which is particularly useful in scenarios where the data is constantly changing or expanding. Instead of being constrained to the knowledge that the model was trained on, Agentic RAG systems can retrieve fresh data and generate responses based on the most current information available.In summary, Agentic RAG is a hybrid model that intelligently combines retrieval and generation, acting like an autonomous agent to enhance the quality and relevance of responses in AI applications.
