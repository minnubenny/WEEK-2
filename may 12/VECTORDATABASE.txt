Vector Database
A vector database is a special kind of database designed to store and search data using vectors , numerical representations of things like text, images, audio, or video. These vectors are often called embeddings, and they capture the meaning or features of the data in a mathematical form. For example, if we convert the sentence “I love cats” into a 384-dimensional vector using an AI model, each number in the vector helps represent the meaning of the sentence.Traditional databases search by exact matches or keywords. In contrast, vector databases search by similarity in meaning using something called nearest neighbor search. This is useful when we’re not looking for exact matches, but rather for content that is similar , like finding documents related to a topic even if they don't use the same words.This kind of database is especially useful in AI and machine learning applications. For example, chatbots, recommendation systems, image recognition tools, and search engines often use vector databases to find the most relevant results. When we ask a question like "What is AI?" a vector database can retrieve documents with related content, even if the exact phrase doesn’t appear.Vector databases are built to handle large-scale and high-dimensional data efficiently. They often use specialized indexing methods like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) to speed up searches. Examples of popular vector databases include ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate, and Milvus.As more AI tools generate embeddings from data, vector databases are becoming essential for storing and using that data meaningfully. They make it possible to search by meaning rather than just text. This unlocks smarter, more flexible applications  from semantic search to intelligent assistants.
