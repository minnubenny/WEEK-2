In a single-agent RAG system, one large language model does everything—from retrieving relevant information to understanding it and generating a response. It’s a straightforward setup where a single model handles the entire process from start to finish.Multi-agent RAG, on the other hand, works differently. Instead of one model doing all the work, several LLM-based agents collaborate, each focusing on a specific part of the task. For example, one agent might be responsible for finding the right documents, another might evaluate how relevant they are, and a third could focus on crafting a clear, helpful response.The single-agent approach is generally simpler and faster. It’s easy to build and works well for tasks like answering questions from a document or powering a chatbot—especially when the task doesn’t require deep or layered reasoning.Multi-agent RAG systems are better suited for more complex problems. Because the work is divided among specialized agents, they can dig deeper into the task, coordinate across multiple sources, and handle more nuanced or multi-step queries. This makes them more flexible and powerful, though they do come with higher complexity and slower response times due to the need for coordination between agents.In short, single-agent RAG is great when you need something quick and simple, while multi-agent RAG shines in situations that call for deeper analysis, multiple viewpoints, or more sophisticated reasoning.
